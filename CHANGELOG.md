## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-17

### Added / Changed

- **The detail modal now reads baked data — no live Discogs call, immune to rate limits.**
  A single weekly `get_release` pass per record bakes everything the modal shows:
  - immutable parts (tracklist, country, release date, videos) → static per-release files
    at `public/releases/<id>.json`, loaded directly by the modal and cached forever. A
    pressing's tracklist never changes, so files are written once and existing ones are
    never rewritten (weekly diffs stay tiny).
  - changing parts (community rating, have/want, lowest sale) → fields on each record in
    `collection.json`, refreshed weekly, so the stat cells are instant and ≤1 week fresh.

  The modal falls back to the live `/api/release` proxy only for a brand-new record whose
  file hasn't been baked yet. This removes the "Track 1, 2…" placeholders and the
  rate-limit failures entirely. `refresh_collection.py` now runs one `get_release` pass
  (flags `SKIP_RELEASES` / `RELEASE_NEW_ONLY` / `RELEASE_LIMIT`) that **replaces the
  separate marketplace price bake** — `get_release` returns the lowest price too.

---

## [0.2.2] — 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **Tracklists always resolve; the generic "Track 1, 2…" placeholders are gone.** The
  modal used to render fabricated track names instantly, then swap in the real ones —
  and when the Discogs fetch failed (a transient 429 rate-limit) the fakes stayed. Now
  it shows a shimmer skeleton while loading, then the real tracks — or an honest "no
  tracklist" / "couldn't reach Discogs — Retry", never fabricated ones. The
  `/api/release` fetch retries transient failures on both the client and the proxy, and
  results are cached in `localStorage` (tracklists are immutable) so a record you've
  opened before is instant and never re-fetched. Removed the mock track / rating /
  have-want fallbacks entirely.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-08-17

### Changed

- **Sharper cover art.** Covers now use Discogs' `cover_image` (~600px, quality 90)
  instead of the 150px `thumb`, which was being upscaled to ~380px on Retina and looked
  pixelated. `deco()` prefers `cover_image`, falls back to `thumb`, then the no-cover
  placeholder. `refresh_collection.py` and `build_collection.py` now capture
  `cover_image`, and `refresh_collection.py` gains a `SKIP_PRICES` mode for a ~1-minute
  metadata + cover refresh (no price bake). Regenerating `collection.json` also picked up
  3 newly-added records (1,850 → 1,853).

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-17

### Added

- **Self-updating pipeline — no Claude, no Cowork, no local machine.**
  `.github/workflows/refresh-collection.yml` runs weekly (and on demand via *Run
  workflow*) and rebuilds `public/collection.json` from the Discogs API through
  `build/refresh_collection.py` — new records, edits, and **baked marketplace low
  prices** — then commits it; Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys. A price that fails to
  fetch keeps its previous value, so a rough API day never wipes prices. Replaces the
  old Cowork `rebuild-record-collection` task. One-time setup: add `DISCOGS_TOKEN` as a
  GitHub **Actions** secret (separate from the Pages secret).
- **Designed no-cover placeholder.** Records without album art now render a flat
  vinyl-disc placeholder — black disc, red label, artist initials, no gradients — in the
  TraxWax idiom, instead of a blank grey box. Applies to cards, timeline tiles, the
  ledger, and the detail modal.

### Changed

- DEPLOY step 6 rewritten from "manual weekly Cowork task" to the automated Actions
  workflow.

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **Covers now load.** Card / timeline / ledger / modal cover art was written as
  `background-image:url("…")` inside a double-quoted `style="…"` attribute, so the
  inner double quotes closed the attribute early and every cover URL parsed to
  `url("")` — no album art loaded anywhere on the deployed site. Switched the `url()`
  in `deco()` to single quotes. Diagnosed on the live deploy (`traxwax.pages.dev`):
  computed `background-image` was `url("")` and **0** of 1,850 covers ever fetched;
  the Discogs CDN serves thumbs to the pages.dev origin fine (no hotlink block), so
  the empty URL was the whole cause.

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-17

Initial build: the Claude Design redesign ported into a standalone site on the full
~1,850-record collection, plus the Discogs proxy. Not yet deployed — **v1.0.0** is
reserved for the first live deploy on Cloudflare Pages with the custom domain and
baked prices (see `docs/roadmap.md`).

### Added

- Production site (`public/`): `index.html` + `styles.css` + `app.js`, ported off
  the Claude Design runtime (`support.js` / `<x-dc>`) into a dependency-free vanilla
  renderer that copies the kit's inline styling verbatim.
- Three views — **THE CRATE** (grid), **TIMELINE** (by month added), **THE LEDGER**
  (stats) — over `public/collection.json` (1,850 records, flat shape).
- Composable facet filters (STYLE / WAX / ARTIST / COLOR / SEARCH) with the SHOWING
  chip row; single segmented sort (ADDED / ARTIST / YEAR / PRICE) + direction toggle.
- Light/dark themes (persisted, respects `prefers-color-scheme`); responsive columns
  6→2; loading, empty, and detail-modal states.
- Cloudflare Pages Functions proxy — `functions/api/release/[id].js`, `value.js`,
  `price/[id].js` — holding the Discogs token server-side, with edge caching and
  strict id validation.
- `app.js` calls the proxy for the detail modal and header value, with a graceful
  mock fallback so local dev (no proxy) still works.
- `build/build_collection.py` maps `discogs_records.json` → `public/collection.json`.
- Docs + versioning: `README.md` (version badge), `DEPLOY.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION`, and the `sync-version-badge` workflow.

### Notes

- Covers load from the Discogs CDN (`thumb`); no base64 (unlike the Cowork artifact).
- Per-record grid prices read `—` until the weekly price-bake lands (roadmap v1.1.0);
  the header EST. value and the modal's lowest sale go live once the token is set.
